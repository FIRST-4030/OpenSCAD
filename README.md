# OpenSCAD
This is a folder of OpenSCAD files used to simulate our various autonomous goals for FTC team 7462.

OpenSCAD is a text based CAD (Computer Aided Design) application that we will be using to prototype our efforts at autonomous programming. Once a field is defined then pseudo-robots can be added to show discreet locations that we want the robot to be placed in order to identify coordinates that can be directly fed into ‘’RoadRunner’’.  A sample simulation can be found in the **2019 – Skystone** folder in a file called *Simulator.png* and is pictured below:

# Directory Structure

The ‘’OpenSCAD’’ folder is the parent folder for all seasonal competitions. Beneath it are individual folders for each year’s competition. Additionally, there is a folder called **Global** which holds all of the SCAD files used to build a generic field.

Within each competition folder will exist, at a minimum, the following 2 files:
* xxxField.scad – The SCAD code used to layout the entire field
* xxxField.png – Screen capture, in a *png* format of the final field

	**Note**: where, “xxx” is the name of the competition (e.g., “Skystone”, “FreightFrenzy”, etc.)

# Git

Git is the configuration management software used to ensure that all files are protected as they change over time. OpenSCAD is **not** compatible with Android Studio so specific instructions on using Git at the command line will be detailed in subsequent sections.
